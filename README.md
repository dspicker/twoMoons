# twoMoons
Implementation of the Runge Kutta algorithm to simulate the movement of two Saturn-moons.

The goal of this work is to use numerical integration to determine (and in theory animate) the trajectories of the moons in time and measure how often they exchange their orbits.

For more information and the complete task, look at [proj2_two_moons.pdf](proj2_two_moons.pdf).
